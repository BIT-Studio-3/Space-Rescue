## How to play

The goal of this game is to rescue animals off each planet and escape the area before the black hole swallows everyone. As the game is very early in development the gameplay loop is still being iterated on.
<!-- More detailed explanation of the gameplay loop when it is finshed -->

The controls are shown in game when opening the menu. The current controls are as follows:
